# Stable-project-----predict-future-price-of-stock
Also a side project for Stable Capital. The assignment is to predict the future tendency of the stock price. Initially, I want to use arima model, 
but it is not very useful since the best model to use is arima(0,0,0). Instead, I used a LSTM model.
